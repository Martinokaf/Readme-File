# Readme-File

## Description

This application is a README Generator which is a powerful command-line tool for generating well-structured and standardized README files for your React projects. This tool streamlines the process by providing interactive prompts that enable users to create organised README documentation that efficiently conveys crucial information about their projects.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using the command: git clone [Readme-generator](https://github.com/Martinokaf/Readme-Generator) 
- Install the necessary dependencies, including the Inquirer package,
```bash
npm install
```
- Navigate to the folder containing index.js, either with the command prompt or with VS Code's integrated terminal.
```bash
index.js
```
- Then the application should be running by using the following command:
```bash
node index.js
```



## Usage
Type the command node index.js in the terminal to launch the Readme Generator. As you fill in the prompts with details about the title of your projct and other prompt, the generator will use your input to produce the README file.

There are two questions that require you to use the arrows on your keyboard to select your choice. Once completed, the README will be generated and saved in the Output folder
